About two months ago I proposed doing a short term swap with someone from any other squad in the London engineering channel. I had a few responses and eventually got together with Andi Rutherford in the Flux Capacitor squad to work out the details and give it a go. We decided to limit it to two weeks and do the swap in turns, with each person being the "point of contact" for the other in their squad. I went first and joined up with Flux Capacitor for two weeks starting 20 Nov, which aligned with one of their sprints.

Why?

There's a long list of reasons why doing a squad swap like this is beneficial, both for the joiner and the squad taking them on:

Meet other squad members: especially in the London office where cross squad interactions are a bit... rare, working next to people for a couple of weeks is a great way to get to know them both personally and professionally.
Learn more about our domain: if you work in one vertical most of the time, getting to know about other parts of the business with their terminology and challenges is a great way to learn more about what we do at Skyscanner. When you know more areas you're better able to connect the dots, spot similarities, and offer suggestions & solutions that solve more than your specific need. You also get to learn this areas at a much finer level than a 10 minute overview talk most of us got during induction.
Learn & spread processes: find out what works for other squads in their workflow and agile process, or share something from your squad that might help out. Squads work in wildly different ways across the company, and what works for one squad might not work for another, but knowing about the practices makes picking and choosing easier. Similarly, writing a blog post about your squad's practice might not be relatable to another squad, but showing them how it works while you're there for a bit might make it click and really help them out.
Learn new tech: while we try to standardise our tech stack within reason here, there's always going to be differences (hopefully for the right reason!). Similar to the above, getting an overview of a tech that might really help you is different from working with it in anger for a couple of weeks, and bringing that knowledge back to your squad might solve an issue you're having now or in the future.
Fresh set of eyes: perhaps a fresh perspective to a problem the new squad is working on is just what they need, or to a problem they didn't even know they had! We all get numb to negative issues (fire fighting, alarm fatigue, etc) and it often takes a new joiner or similar to point this out and make everyone aware.
Test new squad member & project procedures: When you get a full time new joiner on the squad you probably have a doc that list what they need access to, how to setup their box, etc. Written once and forgotten about until the next new joiner, when you uncover issues? Try them out with a temporary joiner! See what links are dead, what getting started guides need updated, etc.

The downsides I could see with this is include:

The productivity hit each squad will take - the one you're leaving and the one you're joining
Squad you're leaving: it shouldn't be different from you being off on holiday, out ill, etc. You're pairing & sharing progress regularly so work can be picked up seamlessly, right? At least it'll give a test to your bus factor and allow the squad to adjust siloing, knowledge, responsibilities, etc to cope with you being gone in the future. I don't think any of us should be in a position that our squads can't function in our absence. Plus you're still around this worst case scenario surfaces!
Squad you're joining: since you're already in the company, you know how we work at a broad scale (ie MShell, Slingshot, etc), have most of your HR & permission issues sorted, know where to go for issues, etc. This means the productivity hit is much smaller than a full time new joiner. Also having your dedicated point of contact for the squad means only they should be a bit slowed down helping you get up to speed rather than the whole squad.
Too many swaps happening at once: obviously everyone moving at once is a bad idea  We can introduce back pressure and throttling to control the rate!
Results

Andi and I made a short survey for both the person joining (myself in this case), and the squad we went into. Here's some results out of 5:

I know the joiner better than I did before: 3.83
Learned something new from the joiner: 3.33
I'd try swapping to another squad after seeing this: 3.6

Along with some great comments about the experience. This is obviously a single experiment, and a few factors impacted the results, including:

an abnormally large % of the squad out on different days due to unfortunate illness, emergency WFH requirements, etc
working on a project revolving around one I'd worked on before, so I was able to share a lot of information around it and really help out
the new squad being literally next door to my current one so I knew them a bit already 

For myself it was a great refresher to tackle something out of the ordinary, learn about their challenges, and get to know them even better.

What next?

I'd love to see this ran on a trial basis across more of the company! Perhaps even across disciplines (ie engineers working with User Satisfaction to feel customer pain), and across office locations (though that's a bit more ££)? I'll be asking around about the possibilities.

Has anyone else done something similar to this? What was your experience?

I'd like to thank everyone in Flux Capacitor for taking me on for those two weeks, and Andi for working with me to get this moving!
