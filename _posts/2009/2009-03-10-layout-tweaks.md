OK, maybe not so much tweaks as borderline major reconstruction. I change the layout to give it a fluid width and replaced my syntax highlighter, which was getting on my nerves, with a new one that appears to be working _much_ better. Time will tell, though.

If you're reading this through an RSS reader (and honestly, who isn't?), the code samples should be a bit more legible, and less mangled up for no good reason, going forward. If by some chance my touching up all the previous posts relisted them as new in your reader - and it hasn't for Google Reader - then I apologize. I'm done now, I hope.

Anyway, on to more actual posts.
