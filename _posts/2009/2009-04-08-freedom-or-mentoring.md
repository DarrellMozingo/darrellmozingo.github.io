Let's take a hypothetical here and say you're looking at two jobs. They're at roughly similar companies which we'll call Company A and Company B (I know, I know, original, right?). You'd be working on similar projects at either and they both have comparable co-workers. For all intents and purposes they're equal, save for one glaring difference:

- Company A gives you more freedom to "explore". You're more or less given time to read up on things, try new technologies & methodologies knowing full well some will fail and basically waste time (and given some extra slack in your schedule to compensate), get some extra training here and there, and not have a pink slip waived in front of you if you happen to let a few bugs through to production.
- Company B has one or more senior developers that honestly love their craft, push continous learning, and can mentor you in advanced - and "proper" - directions and techniques. Test driven development? Check. SOLID principals and their real-world application? Check. Domain driven design? Check. I'm not just talking about guys that have read up on these topics either, but that have years of experience in them and a metric crap load of failures under their belts that they're willing to share inorder to help insure you don't fall into them too. They take pride in all aspects of their job and won't stand for letting things slide.

Which would you choose?

It's tough. The benefits Company A provides could get you to the same end goal as Company B, albeit at a slower pace. Company B would presumably be stricter on slip-ups and time management, so if you're using a technology you're not terribly interested in or you're taking a route you don't agree with, there's not much you can do without working on your dime.

You're not guaranteed to ever reach that same end goal with Company A as you would with Company B, though. Self learning is a difficult, slippery slope. You have to encounter all those failures yourself and actually overcome them. Granted, failing for yourself teaches you something more than just hearing a warning from a mentor, but those failures take time, and I believe there's a quote about these situations... something along the lines of "Those who fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it", I believe.

Me, personally? I'm not sure. I can see it both ways, though I've only had the pleasure (?) of working with companys similar Company A. It's a tough decision, and my answer probably depends on what day you ask me. I know I'd like to see what the other side of the fence has to offer though.

What's your take?
