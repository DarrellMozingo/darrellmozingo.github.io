A week or two agoÂ [Jason Lautzenheiser](http://www.malachicomputer.com/blog/)Â emailed around about to a few of us about starting a local [Code and Coffee](http://www.codeandcoffee.info/) here in the Canton area, and I think it's a great idea. We haven't set a schedule or anything, but the first get together will be Friday, May 15th @ 7 AM at [Canton Arabica](http://cantonarabica.com/), right on DresslerÂ in Belden. Everyone's already busy in the evenings, so we figure we'll give this whole "first thing in the morning" time slot a shot.

Basically we'll get together to do some pairing on whatever interests everyone, with an eye towards pushing comfort zones (read: new languages and technologies). Very informal. Stop by if you can make it. If we can't figure out what we'll do before next Friday, we'll just call this first one a meet and greet and pick a topic for next time. Since the idea is to pair, don't worry if you don't have a laptop.

Don't fret about the early AM thing. I'm not a morning person myself either (my alarm isn't even set until 7:20 normally), but it should be good to get the ol' brain neurons firing that early in the morning.

If you're interested, let either Jason or myself know. We're planning on keeping it to about an hour in length.

Hope to see you there!
