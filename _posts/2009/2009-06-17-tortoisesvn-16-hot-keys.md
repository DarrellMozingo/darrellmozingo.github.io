The latest releases of [Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) (above 1.6) have taken away the ALT+O hot keys that used to be on every dialog (though it [sounds like they've added them back in to the trunk](http://www.nabble.com/Re:-Bug--Alt%2BO-on-commit-dialog-no-longer-OKs-it-p23553686.html)). This caused quite an uproar by many keyboarders, myself included.

Until the trunk is stable and the ALT+O keys are reintroduced, though, know that CTRL+ENTER will substitute on pretty much all the dialogs (or ESC for Cancel). These are the "standard" Windows OK & Cancel shortcuts, and apparently the custom accelerator keys are hold overs from legacy WinAPI code.

I've grown accustomed to CTRL+ENTER at this point, but I'll be happy to hopefully have my old friend, ALT+O, back soon.
