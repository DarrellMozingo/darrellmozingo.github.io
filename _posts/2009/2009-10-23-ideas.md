My recent lack of posts aren't so much because I don't have the time or desire to do them, I just don't have any ideas left to post about. Nothing terribly exciting going on at work and no time for development stuff at home. I tried getting my company to open source an old ASP.NET page I wrote (actually, my first "professional" one) that was quite successful but has since been replaced for a new direction, but they unfortunately turned it down. I was hoping to walk through it step by step in a huge refactoring series of posts, adding tests, getting rid of the huge amounts of inline SQL, etc. Maybe I'll work on getting them to do that again.

In the mean time it's back to the drawing board for post ideas. I prefer series and actual code/concrete posts, so maybe a small app? That seems over done though, not to mention the odds of me actually seeing it the whole way through are pretty slim. Hmmmmmm.
