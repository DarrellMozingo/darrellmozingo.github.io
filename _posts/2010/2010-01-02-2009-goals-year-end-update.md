2009's over. How did I do on my [goals for last year](http://darrell.mozingo.net/2009/01/02/new-year-new-goals-2009/)? Let's see (comments in italics after each goal):

### Books

1. [Code Complete - Steve McConnell](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) (yep, I've never actually read it)    _No progress._
2. [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture - Martin Fowler](http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229896370&sr=8-1)    _No progress._
3. [Domain Driven Design - Erick Evans](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229896453&sr=1-1)    _Done._
4. [Working Effectively With Legacy Code - Michael Feathers](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229896657&sr=1-1)    _No progress._

### Tools/Techniques/Processes @ Work

- NHibernate and all its trimmings (FluentNHibernate, LINQ to NHibernate, etc), which I'll need on a project here real soon.  _Done._
- Actually move from CC.NET to Team City (last attempt didn't go so well).  _No progress._
- Build a more robust build script and management process - including production deployment scenarios.   _No progress._
- Messaging framework, either [MassTransit](http://code.google.com/p/masstransit/), [NServiceBus](http://www.nservicebus.com/), or Ayende's new [Rhino Service Bus](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/12/17/rhino-service-bus.aspx) if he's able to release it in time for our current project.  _Didn't need it, so no progress._

### Involvement

- We have weekly meetings to catch everyone up on what we're doing, but I want to present on an actual topic during at least 2 of these - and present in a way where the other development teams will see the use in picking up the presented tool/technique.    _Meetings still halted - no progress._
- Have at least one meeting of the [CantonALT.NET](http://www.cantonalt.net) group and see if it can ever get up on its feet.   _No progress, and more than likely dead in the water :(_
- The two blog posts per month target John put out there seems doable, so I'll borrow it :)    _Spot on, but no posts during October or November. I'll consider this goal missed, then._
- At least 3 feature/patch submissions to open source projects.  _Done._

### Productivity

- Trim RSS feed size by 1/3 (presently at 127, so trim it to at least 85) and cut time viewing it by half. I've gotten much better this past year at cutting through the useless stuff, but there's still a lot there and it sucks up too much of my time.  _Done._

So, overall I completed 4 of my 13 goals - 31%. Ouch. To be fair, 2 of the goals were out of my hands (didn't need a messaging framework at work yet and didn't want to think up some rinky-dink example project to try it on, and our weekly meetings were cancelled for me to present - though I could have found another venue to present). I was also _pretty_ close on the blog posting goal, only missing a few because I ran short on ideas for a couple of months there.

Ah well, at least I gave them all a shot and completed at least one from each category. I also knocked off a lot of my personal goals for the year, so they sort of balanced out. I'll post my code related goals for the upcoming year later this week.

How'd everyone else do? Have any new ones for this year?
