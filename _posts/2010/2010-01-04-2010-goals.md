Time to lay out some professional and coding related goals for 2010:

### Books

1. [Code Complete - Steve McConnell](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670)
2. [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture - Martin Fowler](http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229896370&sr=8-1)
3. [Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns - Jimmy Nilsson](http://www.amazon.com/Applying-Domain-Driven-Design-Patterns-Examples/dp/0321268202/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)
4. [Working Effectively With Legacy Code - Michael Feathers](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1262481595&sr=1-1)

### Tools/Techniques/Processes @ Work

- Move from SVN to Git (and learn more about Git in the process).
- Move from CC.NET to Team City for our build server.
- Build a more robust build script and management process - including production deployment and database migration scenarios.

### Involvement

- Develop an idea I was given for an open source project and get it live to see what happens.
- At least 24 blog posts (I'm not going to say 2 per month as I'm getting married this summer and I'm certain I won't be able to maintain a schedule around it).
- At least 3 feature/patch submissions to open source projects.

### Coding

- Get a version 1 out there on at least 1 of the 3 product ideas I have floating around.
- Keep working on a good working knowledge of Ruby & Ruby on Rails (and use it to build the product mentioned above).

Pretty similar to last years goals overall, actually. I'll be updating my progress every 3 months instead of 2 this year though.

Set any goals yourself this year?
