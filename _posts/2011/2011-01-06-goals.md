Man, that was a quick year.

### Books

1. [Code Complete - Steve McConnell](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) - **Not started.**
2. [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture - Martin Fowler](http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229896370&sr=8-1)
3. [Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns - Jimmy Nilsson](http://www.amazon.com/Applying-Domain-Driven-Design-Patterns-Examples/dp/0321268202/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)

### Tools/Techniques/Processes @ Work

- Move from SVN to Git (and learn more about Git in the process). - **I've been using Git for side projects, but not at work quite yet, so I'll call this half complete.**
- Move from CC.NET to Team City for our build server.
- Build a more robust build script and management process - including production deployment and database migration scenarios.

### Involvement

- Develop an idea I was given for an open source project and get it live to see what happens. - **[Taskie](http://darrell.mozingo.net/2010/12/16/introducing-taskie/)**
- At least 24 blog posts (I'm not going to say 2 per month as I'm getting married this summer and I'm certain I won't be able to maintain a schedule around it). - **I got 18 out - not too bad.**
- At least 3 feature/patch submissions to open source projects. - **Not started.**

### Coding

- Get a version 1 out there on at least 1 of the 3 product ideas I have floating around. - **Not started.**
- Keep working on a good working knowledge of Ruby & Ruby on Rails (and use it to build the product mentioned above). - **More reading and playing, but no actual project.**

So that's an overall **success rate of 58%** assuming each goal has equal weight (which they really don't, but it saves time). Not that impressive, but probably a bit better than average. My goals are pretty similar to these for 2011, just sub out some technologies and books. I've grown tired of updating them and I'm sure you've grown tired of ignoring the posts in your feed reader, so I'll just call it quits with publicly posting these goals from here out.

You're welcome :)
