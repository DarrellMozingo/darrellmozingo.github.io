[Brandon Joyce](http://www.sonerdy.com/) and I are starting a [Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) group in the Canton area. Appropriately titled [Canton Software Craftsmanship](http://mycraftsmanship.org/), it'll be the first Monday of every month starting at 6pm in Stark State's auditorium. You can get more information at the group's website, [here](http://mycraftsmanship.org/).

If you're interested in attending, [please register](http://software.eventbrite.com) so we have a head count for the provided pizza & drinks.

Hope to see you there!
