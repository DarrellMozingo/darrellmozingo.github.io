Thanks to everyone that attended the first [Canton Software Craftsmanship](http://mycraftsmanship.org/) meeting this past Monday. It was a great turn-out (around 33 people?) and everyone seemed genuinely excited to see where this goes, myself included. Good food and good discussions all around. Sign up for the next meeting on April 4th if you haven't already, and be sure to spread the word to anyone that might be interested. Remember, we're about the practices, not the language, so everyone's welcome.

I'd also like to thank [Brandon Joyce](http://sonerdy.com/) and [John Hoover](http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhoover) for doing a great job with the logistics needed to get this group off the ground. Great job guys!
