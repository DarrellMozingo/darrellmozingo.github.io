Just a quick reminder about the next [Canton Software Craftsmanship](mycraftsmanship.org) meeting on **June 6th**. It's the usual **6pm** at Stark State College with free pizza and drinks, and sponsored by [Synergy Data Systems](http://synergydatasystems.com/) this month (who's coincidentally looking for another [junior C# developer](http://starkjobs.com/JobSeeker/Junior_Software_Developer__Programmer_WJ544824.aspx), if you're interested). Asher McCune will be giving a talk on the [Open/Closed Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle) (the O in SOLID) and we'll be doing more katas together, trying to push the pairing aspect and getting everyone to work with different partners.

Hope everyone can make it! Please don't forget to [register right here](http://software.eventbrite.com/) so we have a head count for pizza.
