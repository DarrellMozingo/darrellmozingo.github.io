I've been at [Synergy Data Systems](http://synergydatasystems.com/) for over 7 years now (I know, the site is horrible). I've worked with a lot of great people on some very interesting projects, and learned a boat load during that time. Unfortunately, they can't offer the one thing my wife and I wanted: living abroad.

To that end, we're moving to London and I'll be starting at [7digital](http://about.7digital.net/) in early January. I'm super excited about both moves. 7digital seems like a great company working with a lot of principals and practices that are near and dear to me, and c'mon, it's London. For two people that grew up in small town Ohio, this'll be quite the adventure!

I'm looking forward to getting involved in the huge developer community over there, playing with new technologies, and working with fellow craftsmen!
