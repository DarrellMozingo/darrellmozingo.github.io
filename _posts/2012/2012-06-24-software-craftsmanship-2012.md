I attended the [Software Craftsmanship 2012](http://www.codemanship.co.uk/softwarecraftsmanship/) conference last Thursday up at Bletchley Park. It was an awesome event ran mostly by [Jason Gorman](http://www.codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/) and the staff at the park. The company I work for, 7digital, sponsored the event so all ticket proceeds went directly to help the park, which is very cool. They're in desperate need for funding and this event has brought in a hefty amount the past few years.

I did the Pathfinding Peril track in the morning. They went over basic pathfinding algorithms, including brute force and A\*, and their applicability outside the gaming world. The rest of the session was spent pairing on bots that compete against other bots trying to automatically navigate a maze the fastest (using [this open source tournament server](https://github.com/mattwynne/robot_tournament)). Unfortunately they didn't have mono installed, so my pair and I wasted some time getting NetBeans installed and a basic Java app up and running. Very interesting, and it spurred a co-worker to setup a tournament server at work too. Looking forward to submitting a bot there to try out some path finding algorithms.

During our lunch break they gave a nice, albeit quick, tour of the park. We got to see the main sites, including Colossus. Very interesting stuff, and amazing to hear how they pulled off all those decoding and computational feats during the war.

For the afternoon I went to the Team Dojo session. We were told to write our strongest languages on name badges, then break off into teams of 4-6 based on that. I got together with a group of 6 devs, some co-workers. After a brief overview of the Google PageRank algorithm and a generic nearest neighbor one, we were set loose to create a developer-centric LinkedIn clone from a complete standing start. We had to figure out where to host our code, how to integrate, code the algorithms, parse in XML data, and throw it all up on the screen somehow in around 2 hours. Unfortunately we spent way too much time shaving yaks, as it were, with testing and our CI environment, and didn't get to the algorithms until the end (although we were close to finishing it!). Learned a bit about trying to jump start a project like that with different personalities and making it all mesh together. It'd be interesting to see how we'd all do it again, especially since katas are meant to be repeated.

Between the talks, lunch, hog roast dinner, tour, and the great little side discussions had between it all, it was an excellent event (although they could try doing something about those beer prices!). Everyone did a great job putting it on. Here's a [video of the day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXJOU6G-sOA) Jason put together (I'm one of the last pair of interviews during our afternoon session). I'm quite looking forward to attending it again in the future.
