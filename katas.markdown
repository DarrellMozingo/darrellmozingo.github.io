[Code Katas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) are short programming exercises meant to hone your skills through repetition. They're also handy for learning new languages, practicing your keyboard skills, and more. Here's a collection of some of the neater ones I've ran across:

* [Guilded Rose](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata)
* [Bowling Game](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata)
* [String calculator](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1) (and [part 2](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-2))
* [Big collection of random katas](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html#more)
* String stack - have it throw an exception for popping an empty stack, pop a single item, and pop two items correctly
* Dollar amount to wording - convert a given dollar amount (say $1,132.53) to wording like you'd use on your checks ("one thousand, one hundred thirty two and 53/100")
